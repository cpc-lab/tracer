TraceR v2
===========

TraceR is a trace replay tool built upon the ROSS-based CODES simulation
framework. TraceR can be used for predicting network performance and
understanding network behavior by simulating messaging in High Performance
Computing applications on interconnection networks.

### Build

* Download and install ROSS:
```
git clone https://github.com/carothersc/ROSS
```
Latest verified commit: de26e581a312fd122a4c06917bf0f3d21f38a24b

* Download and install CODES:
```
Website: https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes
git clone https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes.git
```
Latest verfied commit (from master): 8f56c9608eb07922971242d76bae88ad0c7aa789

Pending pull request (with new features): https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes/merge_requests/21

* Trace format choice (pick one): 

1) Download and build Charm++ with bgampi target:
```
git clone http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/gerrit/charm
```
Follow instructions in the [Charm++ manual](http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/charm++/A.html). Replace the "charm++" target with bgampi.

2) Down and build scoreP for OTF2 support:

Refer to README.OTF2 file in this directory.

* Set the appropriate paths: ROSS, BASE_DIR/CODES in tracer/Makefile.common.
Also set compilers and flags - CC, CXX, SEQ_CXX, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS. 

If using BigSim format, uncomment SELECT_TRACE = -DTRACER_BIGSIM_TRACES=1,
otherwise SELECT_TRACE = -DTRACER_OTF_TRACES=1 should be left uncommented (one of
two). Accordingly, either set CHARMPATH or ensure that otf2-config (which is 
inside the bin directory of scoreP install) is in your path. Then,
```
cd tracer
make
```

### Run

```
mpirun -np <p> ../traceR --sync=3  -- ../conf/<choose here> <tracer_config>
```

Format of trace_config:
```
<global map file>
<num jobs>
<Trace path for job0> <map file for job0> <number of ranks in job0> <iterations (use 1 if running in normal mode)>
<Trace path for job1> <map file for job1> <number of ranks in job1> <iterations (use 1 if running in normal mode)>
...
```
If "global map file" is not needed, use NA for it and "map file for job*".
For generating simple global and job map file, use the code in utils.
More information on how to set up network config files can be found at
docs/UserWriteUp.txt and in CODES:codes/src/networks/model-net/doc

Example files for BigSim are in jacobi2d, while for OTF2 are in  Sample run command:
```
mpirun -np 8 ../traceR --sync=3  --nkp=16  -- ../conf/tracer-torus.conf tracer_config
```

Please refer to README.OTF for instructions on generating OTF2-MPI trace files.
BigSim-AMPI trace file generation instructions are available at
http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/bigsim/manual-1p.html.
